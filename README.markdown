# homebrew-log

This project is my ongoing quest to create a web-based, authorative, simple, and complete logging system for all my home brews. It's for my own use, but free to use for others who may find it useful.

## Usage

The software is designed to run on a local node.js server with a local copy of couchdb. It can easily be configured to run on a virtual server out on the internet, with a free couch provider like iris couch for example.

Clone the repository to your server environment, then run `npm install` to install dependencies.
